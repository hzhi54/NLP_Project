# MVP

For this mvp, I've use the pyLADvis library tool to create a visualization for each possible type of jobs of the resumes. In total
there are 24 different job titles featuring:

  -HR 
  -DESIGNER 
  -INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY 
  -TEACHER 
  -ADVOCATE
  -BUSINESS-DEVELOPMENT 
  -HEALTHCARE 
  -FITNESS 
  -AGRICULTURE
  -BPO 
  -SALES 
  -CONSULTANT 
  -DIGITAL-MEDIA 
  -AUTOMOBILE
  -CHEF 
  -FINANCE 
  -APPAREL 
  -ENGINEERING 
  -ACCOUNTANT
  -CONSTRUCTION 
  -PUBLIC-RELATIONS 
  -BANKING 
  -ARTS 
  -AVIATION
  
These are the possible topics are being label as. So I created a visual for the LDA model:

As you can see, topic 1 are associated with Business Development job title with the top 30 word that are refering to this topic.
There are 24 other topic, but this is one example of it.

By the end of this week, I'm looking forward to create a recommendation system for resumes that could possible be label as one 
of the 24 topics here.
