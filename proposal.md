# Proposal
## Design
For the project, I am trying to create recommendation system for recruiters so that they can look for similar resumes of what they are looking for. The goal is
to help recruiters to look for potential workers that will best fit the jobs got certain positions.

## Data
The data, I looking to get resumes of multiple fields and extracting key words that shows great similarity of job titles. Data will include in text of
backgrounds, experience, education, and other possible information of the specific person.

## Algorithm
The algorithm I will be using is clustering to build a recommendation system. Topic modeling is something I'm looking forward to create so that the system will 
notice the similarity of the resumes. Then we can use this to find workers that have strong similarities so it can have potential working for a specific job.

## Tools
I will be using general python libraries such as Numpy and Pandas to extract data into dataframe and matrixies. I will also be using NLP libraries such as NLTK,
spaCy, and skit-learn for modeling. Visualizations will be using matploylib, seaborn, and Plotely. If possible, I wanted to create a visual comparison of two
resumes with marks that show how well my model will be working.

## MVP
The MVP will be EDA of the dataset and also some visuals of key findings.
